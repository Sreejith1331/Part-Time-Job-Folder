Since you have software development experience, why are you looking for a software testing job?
	My previous job was as a dotNet full-stack developer. I entered into the IT field without any background in it. So I have to double-up my efforts to learn both front-end and back-end technologies. After a while I lost my confidence and I was hopeless that I could learn these things. My insecurities and lack of confidence insist me to change my career. During my development career, I was good at unit testing, debugging, bug fixing and all. Since I already worked with software testers, my interest shifted towards software testing.
